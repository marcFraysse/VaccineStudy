# VaccineStudy
A statistical study on the effectiveness of vaccines

Abstract :
In this study we will ask a simple question : have vaccines proven to be effective. What we mean by that is, is there a direct correlation between the use of vaccines on a portion of population and the reduction of the number of cases of illness prevented by said vaccine. 
We start here by showing that simply showing a decrease in diseases accompanying an increase in vaccines over the years, while providing positive insights, does not prove the efficiency of vaccines. We then try to derive a more complete approach to prove actual causation.
